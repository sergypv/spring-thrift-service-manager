spring-thrift-service-manager
=============================

Manage Thrift services through XML configuration

This little jar will allow you configure Thrift services using an xml or text driven configuration, there are two main advantages on this approach:
 * Determine which services start on your application through configuration, no need to modify code
 * Change the transport, ports, service implementation... all from the configuration
